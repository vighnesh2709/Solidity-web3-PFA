# Solidity-web3-PFA

This repository contains the implementation of a **Decentralized Donation System** designed to support **wildlife rehabilitation and rescue organizations**. The system aims to enhance transparency and efficiency by directing donations directly to the suppliers identified by wildlife rescue centers, minimizing the risk of fraud and ensuring funds are used as intended.

## AIM

This project is a **modified version** of the paper [**"A Track Donation System Using Blockchain"**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9480649). In the original system, funds are moved from donors to charitable organizations. However, this centralized approach still poses the risk of fraud, as donations may not always reach their intended recipients.

### Proposed System

The goal of my system is to eliminate the middleman by directing funds **from donors directly to the suppliers** or services needed by wildlife rescue centers. By leveraging **smart contracts** and **blockchain technology**.

## Technologies and Software Used

This project leverages several key technologies to implement the decentralized donation system:

- **Solidity**: The primary programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Truffle**: A development framework for Ethereum that simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development that allows for testing of smart contracts and transactions in a local environment.
- **Remix**: An open-source web IDE used for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. It's particularly helpful for testing Solidity code in real-time.
- **MetaCoin**: A simple ERC-20 token implementation that allows the creation of custom tokens for transactions within the Ethereum blockchain. Used here to simulate the donation system and manage funds.

## Current Status

A **smart contract** has been developed that facilitates the movement of **Ethereum** directly to designated services. This approach ensures that donations are properly tracked and verified, improving trust between donors and organizations.In the future, Web3 will be integrated to develop a decentralized app(dApp).
